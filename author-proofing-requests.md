## Author Proofing Requests on 11

1. Add caption for table 1

2. Check formatting and abbreviations in table 1 made to allow it to fit in PDF and HTML.

3. References: Unpublished interviews shouldn't appear in the reference section. References are only for sources that are accessible to the reader. If the interviews cannot be published, they shouldn't appear in the reference list (e.g., see https://www.scribbr.com/apa-examples/interview/ ). I would suggest removing the citation to interviews in the Introduction. Where the interviews are cited in later in the text simply put their identifier in brackets e.g., (Spacial Audio Composer 1). You could put the date in the sentence detailing the interviews (e.g., Three spatial audio composers were interviewed in 2021...).

4. In section 3.1 "The reasons why someone may not have access to an array are also not limited to these." - this sentence doesn't appear complete, suggest that it could be deleted without loss of meaning in the paragraph?

5. What is the journal/conference/etc for "Austin-Stewart, Jesse, and Bridget Johnson. 2021."

6. Please ensure all references comply with APA Style, in particular the name formatting is not correct in the example just above (point 5) https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples
